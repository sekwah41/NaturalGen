# [Natural Gen](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/naturalgen)
A minecraft mod which adds the is_natural tag for resource packs to allow variation between player placed blocks and naturally generated.

We may add some additional textures and variations in the future but this is solely designed to be used in custom packs for now.
